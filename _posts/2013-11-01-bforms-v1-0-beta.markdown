After three months of hard work and 600 commits we are very happy to announce the first beta release of BForms UI Framework for ASP.NET MVC.

The BForms framework consists of a collection of ASP.NET MVC HTML Helpers, Javascript AMD modules, custom CSS made with SASS that extends Twitter Bootstrap v3 and makes development of rich user interfaces easy.

BForms is an open source project released under the terms of the MIT and GPL licenses. 

Source code and documentation are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/vtfuture/BForms/).
